1. LilUCBHeuristicCollaborative:
    added a few extra methods for use with CollaborativeActions
    added functionality to work on a subset of arms out of the total

2. CollaborativeAgent:
    implementation of one agent
    follows the steps of the algorithm for the set of arms assigned to it

3. CollaborativeMaster:
    maintains a set of agents
    interacts with agents during the communication step
    returns the overall best arm as per the algorithm

4. CollaborativeLearningProtocol:
    the collaborative master has slightly different mechanics
    hence, the SinglePlayerProtocol could not work with it
    this protocol is pretty specific to the current algorithm, but is useful to compare similar versions of this algorithm or this algorithm with other single player learners by creating two separate "games"
